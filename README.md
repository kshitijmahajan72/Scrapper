# Web Scrapper
<h3>WEB SCRAPER</h3>
Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. Web scraping software may access the World Wide Web directly using the Hypertext 
The scrappy module of python makes it simple to extract data and store it in csv or excel files.
For this, you must have a bit knowledge of html tags and ids.

Here, I have made 2 scrapers:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones//">Game of thrones Episode names From Reddit website</a></li>: Data is extracted and saved in file reddit.csv
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.in/s/ref=s9_acss_bw_cts_VodooFS_T3L4_w?rh=n%3A976419031%2Cn%3A!976420031%2Cn%3A1389401031%2Cn%3A1389432031%2Cn%3A1805560031%2Cp_36%3A1318505031/">Phones Prices from Amazon</a></li> : Data is extracted and saved in amazon.csv
</ul>
